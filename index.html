      <p>The manuscript known as <strong><em>Some of Them</em></strong> has demonstrated anomalous literary behaviour, reportedly inducing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sudden obsession</li>
        <li>Psychological dependence</li>
        <li>Burnt fingertips from excessive page-turning</li>
        <li>Voluntary social withdrawal</li>
        <li>Temporary belief that everyone is suspicious</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Eyewitnesses claim this is <strong>intentional</strong> — part of an initiation tactic designed to erase the identities of new recruits through narrative immersion.<br>
      Those affected begin referring to themselves as <strong>Spectres</strong>, blending into public life undetected.</p>

      <p>They could be:<br>
      • On your commute<br>
      • In your office<br>
      • Sitting at your dinner table</p>

      <h3>IF YOU SUSPECT SOMEONE HAS READ <em>SOME OF THEM</em>:</h3>
      <p><strong>Do not confront.<br>Do not engage.<br>Do not read it yourself.</strong></p>
      <p>Even if your friends, coworkers — or grandmother — recommend it.</p>
      <h3>Remain alert. Resist the pull. Stay out of the shadows.</h3>
