      <h2>📂 TOP PRIORITY CASE FILE — INTERCEPTION: SUCCESSFUL</h2>

      <p><strong>CLASSIFICATION:</strong> Omega-Level Threat<br>
      <strong>SUBJECT:</strong> C. B. Spectre<br>
      <strong>STATUS:</strong> Active. Escalating. Must be stopped.</p>

      <h3>🧠 WARNING:</h3>
      <p>Subject is armed with high-level psychological warfare, narrative distortion, and an imagination that won’t shut the hell up.<br>
      Attempts to neutralise have failed.<br>
      Attempts to ignore have made it worse.</p>

     <h3>📍 Confirmed Site: <span style="background:black; color:black;">██ ███ ██ ███████</span> — Location Scrambled</h3>
<p>Believed to be operating from an environment hostile to both logic and morality.<br>
Controlled entirely by Spectre’s design. No escape observed.</p>

<h3>🧾 Operatives Identified (Aliases Only):</h3>
<ul>
  <li><span style="background:black; color:black;">█████████████</span> — callsign: “👑 The Prince” — status: volatile (charm weaponised)</li>
  <li><span style="background:black; color:black;">██████████</span> — callsign: “🎤 The Siren” — status: seductive & unhinged (do not follow her voice)</li>
  <li><span style="background:black; color:black;">████████████████</span> — callsign: “👻 The Ghost” — status: missing, presumed lethal (never seen coming — never seen twice.)</li>
  <li><span style="background:black; color:black;">████████████</span> — callsign: “✝️ The Saint” — status: corrupted (prays before torture. For your sins, not his.)</li>
  <li><span style="background:black; color:black;">████████████</span> — callsign: “🔪 The Butcher” — status: surgical & unflinching (cut off a man’s leg, stitched it back, kept dancing).</li>
  <li><span style="background:black; color:black;">███████████</span> — callsign: “😈 The Devil’s Pet” — status: please don’t engage (we don’t talk about this one)</li>
</ul>


      <h3>🛠️ MISSION INTEL:</h3>
      <p>They’re not students.<br>
      They’re not survivors.<br>
      They’re assets — volatile, unpredictable, loyal only to madness.</p>

      <p>The curriculum has evolved. The rules have been erased.<br>
      Each of them carries traces of C. B. Spectre’s influence — linguistic sabotage, narrative hacking, emotional destabilisation.</p>

      <p>They are not characters. They are weapons.<br>
      And they are already deployed.</p>

      <h3>🚨 AGENT ALERT:</h3>
      <p>Do not attempt to reason with C. B. Spectre.<br>
      Subject's imagination is uncontainable, deeply caffeinated, and shows no signs of fatigue.<br>
      Known to shatter genre boundaries, pacing protocols, and reader expectations.</p>

      <p>This is not a drill.<br>
      This is not fiction.<br>
      This is Spectre.</p>

      <h3>🧊 CODE NAME:</h3>
      <p><strong>ALL OF THEM</strong> — Pending Activation</p>

      <h3>🔥 Projected Impact:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Emotional devastation</li>
        <li>Cognitive whiplash</li>
        <li>Sudden obsession</li>
        <li>Withdrawal from reality</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>📌 CONCLUSION:</h3>
      <p>C. B. Spectre must be stopped.<br>
      Unfortunately, they’ve already written this ending.<br>
      And they wrote you into it.</p>

      <p><strong>COMING SOON.</strong><br>
      We tried to stop it. We failed.<br>
      Now it’s your turn.</p>

      <h3>⚠️ SECURITY BREACH — PRIORITY CODE: SPECTRE</h3>
      <p>These files were never cleared for release.<br>
      After the psychological wreckage caused by Some of Them, this sequel was stamped: UNRELEASABLE.</p>

      <p>But suppression failed.</p>

      <p>The Spectres have already mobilised.<br>
      They’re multiplying. Off-grid. Embedded deep.</p>

      <p>If All of Them hits the public, we lose containment.<br>
      Curiosity will spiral.<br>
      Obsession will spread like smoke.</p>

      <p>And once it’s out—<br>
      there’s no vault deep enough to lock it away again.</p>
